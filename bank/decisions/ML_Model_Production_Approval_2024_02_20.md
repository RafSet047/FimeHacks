**Date:** February 20, 2024  
**Department:** AI/ML Division  
**Decision Type:** Technology Implementation  
**Status:** APPROVED  

## Executive Summary

Following the comprehensive evaluation presented in the ML Team meeting of February 15, 2024, the Executive Committee has approved the production deployment of the new XGBoost-based loan assessment model. This decision authorizes a gradual rollout strategy with enhanced monitoring and bias mitigation measures.

## Decision Details

### Approved Implementation Plan
- **Deployment Strategy:** Gradual rollout starting with 10% of loan applications
- **Start Date:** March 1, 2024
- **Full Deployment Timeline:** 3 months (June 1, 2024)
- **Budget Allocation:** $450,000 for implementation and monitoring systems

### Model Specifications
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost with 47 features
- **Performance Metrics:** 94.2% accuracy, AUC 0.89, precision-recall 0.91
- **Improvement:** 3.2% improvement over current rule-based system
- **Expected ROI:** $4.1 million annually ($2.3M reduced defaults + $1.8M operational efficiency)

### Risk Mitigation Measures

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Scope | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | March 1-31, 2024 | 10% of applications | <2% error rate, <5% bias variance |
| Phase 2 | April 1-30, 2024 | 50% of applications | <1.5% error rate, <3% bias variance |
| Phase 3 | May 1-31, 2024 | 100% of applications | <1% error rate, <2% bias variance |

## Monitoring and Review

### Weekly Performance Reviews
- Model accuracy and performance metrics
- Bias analysis across demographic segments
- System performance and security monitoring
- Business impact assessment

### Monthly Executive Reports

- Risk assessment updates
- Regulatory compliance status
- Customer satisfaction metrics

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Accuracy:** Maintain >93% overall accuracy
- **Bias:** <5% variance across demographic segments
- **Performance:** <500ms response time for 95% of requests
- **Business Impact:** Achieve projected $4.1M annual savings

### Secondary KPIs
- **System Uptime:** >99.9% availability
- **Security:** Zero security incidents
- **Compliance:** 100% regulatory compliance
- **User Satisfaction:** >4.5/5 rating from loan officers

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Model Performance Degradation:** Mitigated by continuous monitoring and rollback capability
2. **Bias Amplification:** Mitigated by daily bias monitoring and post-processing adjustments
3. **Security Breach:** Mitigated by comprehensive security protocols and access controls
4. **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Mitigated by regular compliance audits and legal review

### Contingency Plans
- **Immediate Rollback:** 15-minute fallback to legacy system
- **Performance Issues:** Gradual reduction in deployment percentage
- **Bias Issues:** Implementation of additional bias mitigation techniques
- **Security Issues:** Complete system shutdown and forensic analysis

## Resource Allocation

### Technology Resources
- **Infrastructure:** $200,000 for cloud computing and storage
- **Security:** $150,000 for security enhancements and monitoring
- **Integration:** $100,000 for system integration and testing

### Human Resources
- **ML Team:** 3 FTE for model monitoring and maintenance
- **Security Team:** 1 FTE for security oversight
- **Risk Team:** 1 FTE for risk monitoring and assessment

## Communication Plan

### Internal Stakeholders
- **Loan Officers:** Training sessions on new system capabilities
- **Risk Management:** Regular updates on model performance and risk metrics
- **Executive Team:** Monthly performance and ROI reports
- **IT Team:** Technical documentation and integration support

### External Stakeholders
- **Regulators:** Quarterly compliance reports
- **Auditors:** Annual audit support and documentation
- **Customers:** Transparent communication about improved loan processing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (This Week):**
   - Complete stress testing and security validation
   - Finalize monitoring dashboard implementation
   - Conduct final training sessions for loan officers

2. **Pre-Deployment (Next Week):**
   - Execute final system integration tests
   - Validate bias monitoring systems
   - Conduct go-live readiness review

3. **Deployment (March 1):**
   - Launch Phase 1 with 10% of applications
   - Begin daily monitoring and reporting
   - Schedule first weekly performance review
