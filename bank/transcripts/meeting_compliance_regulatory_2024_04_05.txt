Voice Transcript 6: Compliance Team - Regulatory Change Implementation

"Compliance Committee meeting, April 5th, 2024, 1 PM to 3 PM. Present: Chief
Compliance Officer Patricia Williams, Regulatory Affairs Director Kevin Johnson,
Legal Counsel Rachel Green, Operations Manager Steven Lee, and Technology Lead
Jennifer Martinez. Discussion focused on implementing the new Banking Regulation
Act 2024 requirements effective July 1st.  Patricia opened by outlining the scope
of changes - the new regulation introduces 23 new compliance requirements across
anti-money laundering, customer due diligence, and transaction monitoring. She
estimated that implementation will require 18 months and $2.8 million in
investment. The most critical requirement is real-time transaction monitoring
with AI-powered anomaly detection.  Kevin presented the regulatory timeline
analysis - we have 87 days until the regulation takes effect, but the regulator
expects implementation plans to be submitted within 30 days. He's identified
three high-risk areas where we're currently non-compliant: enhanced due diligence
for high-risk customers, suspicious activity reporting automation, and cross-border
transaction monitoring.  Rachel detailed the legal implications - the new regulation
increases penalties for non-compliance from $50,000 to $500,000 per violation,
with potential criminal liability for senior management. She emphasized that we
need to demonstrate good faith efforts to comply, even if full implementation
takes longer than the deadline. She's drafting compliance policies and procedures
but needs input from operations on feasibility.  Steven from operations presented
the implementation challenges - our current systems can't support real-time
monitoring of 2.3 million daily transactions. He's evaluated three vendor solutions
ranging from $800,000 to $2.1 million. The mid-tier solution offers 90% of the
required functionality but requires significant integration work. He's also
concerned about staff training requirements - we'll need to train 150 employees
on new procedures.  Jennifer from technology addressed the system integration
requirements - the new monitoring system needs to integrate with our core banking
platform, customer relationship management system, and risk management database.
She estimated 12 months for full integration, but we can implement basic monitoring
within 6 months. She's also concerned about data quality issues that could affect
monitoring accuracy.  The heated discussion was around implementation strategy
and resource allocation. Patricia advocated for a phased approach starting with
high-risk areas, while Kevin insisted on full compliance by the deadline to avoid
regulatory scrutiny. Steven argued that rushing implementation could create
operational risks and suggested requesting a 6-month extension. Rachel cautioned
that requesting extensions could signal non-compliance and recommended immediate
implementation of critical requirements.  Decision reached: Approved phased
implementation with critical requirements by July 1st and full compliance by
October 1st. Budget of $2.8 million approved with quarterly progress reviews.
Action items: Patricia submits implementation plan to regulator by April 15th,
Kevin prioritizes compliance requirements, Rachel finalizes policies by April
30th, Steven begins vendor selection process, Jennifer starts system integration
planning."
