Voice Transcript 8: Marketing Team - Digital Campaign Strategy

"Marketing Strategy Committee meeting, June 8th, 2024, 2 PM to 4 PM. Present:
Chief Marketing Officer Emily Watson, Digital Marketing Director Carlos Mendez,
Product Marketing Manager Jessica Lee, Analytics Lead Ryan Foster, and Budget
Controller Amanda Johnson. Discussion focused on Q3 digital marketing campaign
strategy and budget allocation for our new mobile banking app launch.  Emily
opened by presenting the campaign objectives - we need to acquire 25,000 new
mobile banking users in Q3, increase app downloads by 40%, and achieve a 15%
conversion rate from download to active usage. The target audience is millennials
and Gen Z customers aged 25-40 with household income above $75,000.  Carlos
presented the digital channel strategy - he's proposing a multi-channel approach
with Google Ads (40% of budget), Facebook/Instagram (30%), LinkedIn (15%), and
programmatic display (15%). The total campaign budget is $850,000 with an
expected cost per acquisition of $34. He emphasized that video content performs
2.3x better than static ads for our target demographic.  Jessica detailed the
creative strategy - she's developed three campaign themes: 'Banking Made Simple,'
'Your Money, Your Control,' and 'Smart Banking for Smart People.' A/B testing
shows the 'Smart Banking' theme has 23% higher engagement rates. She's also
proposing influencer partnerships with 5 fintech influencers with combined
reach of 2.1 million followers.  Ryan from analytics presented the performance
projections - based on historical data and market research, he estimates we can
achieve 2.1 million impressions with a 2.8% click-through rate. The conversion
funnel shows 35% of visitors download the app, with 43% of downloaders becoming
active users within 30 days. He's also identified 12 high-performing keywords
for search campaigns.  Amanda from budget addressed the financial constraints
- our Q3 marketing budget is $1.2 million, but we also need to allocate funds
for traditional advertising, PR, and event marketing. She's concerned that the
digital campaign budget represents 71% of total marketing spend, which is higher
than industry average. She suggested reducing the budget to $650,000 to maintain
balance across channels.  The heated discussion was around budget allocation and
channel mix. Carlos argued that digital channels provide better ROI and targeting
capabilities than traditional media. Jessica insisted on maintaining the influencer
budget as it provides authentic reach to our target audience. Ryan advocated for
increasing the Google Ads budget based on strong historical performance. Amanda
cautioned against over-investing in digital channels without proven ROI.  Decision
reached: Approved digital campaign budget of $750,000 with performance-based
adjustments. Google Ads allocation increased to 45%, Facebook/Instagram reduced
to 25%, LinkedIn maintained at 15%, and programmatic reduced to 15%. Action items:
Carlos finalizes channel contracts by June 15th, Jessica begins creative production,
Ryan establishes real-time performance monitoring, Amanda sets up budget tracking
dashboards, Emily schedules weekly performance reviews."
