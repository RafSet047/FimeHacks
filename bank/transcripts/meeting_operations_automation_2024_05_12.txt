Voice Transcript 7: Operations Team - Process Automation Decision

"Operations Automation Committee meeting, May 12th, 2024, 11 AM to 1 PM. Present:
Chief Operations Officer Mark Anderson, Process Improvement Manager Sarah Chen,
Technology Director Alex Rodriguez, Human Resources Director Lisa Thompson, and
Finance Analyst David Kim. Discussion focused on evaluating and implementing
robotic process automation (RPA) for back-office operations.  Mark opened by
presenting the current state analysis - our manual processing operations handle
45,000 transactions daily across loan processing, account maintenance, and
compliance reporting. Current error rate is 2.3% with average processing time
of 3.2 days. He identified 12 processes suitable for automation that could
reduce processing time by 65% and errors by 80%.  Sarah presented the RPA
feasibility study - she evaluated three automation platforms: UiPath, Blue
Prism, and Automation Anywhere. UiPath offers the best integration with our
existing systems and has the lowest implementation cost at $450,000. She
estimated annual savings of $1.2 million in labor costs and $300,000 in error
reduction. The implementation timeline is 8 months with a 6-month ROI period.
 Alex from technology addressed the technical requirements - our current
infrastructure can support RPA deployment, but we need to upgrade our virtual
desktop environment to handle 50 concurrent automation sessions. He's also
concerned about data security and access controls for automated processes.
He estimated additional infrastructure costs of $200,000.  Lisa from HR raised
workforce impact concerns - automation could affect 35 positions across loan
processing and account maintenance teams. She proposed a retraining program
to transition affected employees to customer service and relationship management
roles. The retraining program would cost $150,000 but could reduce severance
costs and maintain institutional knowledge.  David from finance presented the
cost-benefit analysis - total implementation cost of $800,000 with annual
savings of $1.5 million. The project has a positive NPV of $2.3 million over
5 years and an IRR of 28%. However, he cautioned that the savings estimates
assume 100% automation success rate, which may be optimistic.  The key discussion
was around implementation strategy and change management. Mark advocated for
starting with loan processing automation as it has the highest error rates and
processing volumes. Sarah suggested a pilot program with 3 processes to validate
the technology before full deployment. Alex emphasized the need for comprehensive
testing and rollback procedures. Lisa insisted on early communication with
affected employees to minimize resistance.  Decision reached: Approved RPA
implementation starting with loan processing automation. Pilot program with 3
processes to begin July 1st, with full deployment by December 31st. Budget of
$800,000 approved with quarterly progress reviews. Action items: Sarah begins
vendor contract negotiations, Alex starts infrastructure upgrades, Lisa develops
change management plan, David establishes ROI tracking framework, Mark schedules
stakeholder communication sessions."
